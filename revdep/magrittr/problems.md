*   checking whether package ‘rgl’ can be installed ... WARNING
    ```
    Found the following significant warnings:
      Warning: 'rgl.init' failed, running with 'rgl.useNULL = TRUE'.
    See ‘/tmp/workdir/rgl/new/rgl.Rcheck/00install.out’ for details.
    ```

*   checking whether the namespace can be loaded with stated dependencies ... NOTE
    ```
    Warning: 'rgl.init' failed, running with 'rgl.useNULL = TRUE'.
    
    A namespace must be able to be loaded with just the base namespace
    loaded: otherwise if the namespace gets loaded by a saved object, the
    session will be unable to start.
    
    Probably some imports need to be declared in the NAMESPACE file.
    ```

## In both

*   checking installed package size ... NOTE
    ```
      installed size is 10.1Mb
      sub-directories of 1Mb or more:
