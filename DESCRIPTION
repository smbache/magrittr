Version: 1.5.0.9000
Authors@R: 
    c(person(given = "Stefan Milton",
             family = "Bache",
             role = c("aut", "cre", "cph"),
             email = "stefan@stefanbache.dk"),
      person(given = "Hadley",
             family = "Wickham",
             role = "aut",

      person(given = "RStudio",
             role = c("cph", "fnd")))
Description: Provides a mechanism for chaining commands with a
    new forward-pipe operator, %>%. This operator will forward a value, or
    the result of an expression, into the next function call/expression.
    There is flexible support for the type of right-hand side expressions.
    For more information, see package vignette.  To quote Rene Magritte,
    "Ceci n'est pas un pipe."
